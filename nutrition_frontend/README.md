# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- Lightweight: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- Modern UI: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- Fast: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- Simple: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)

## Seeding sample data (Supabase)

For quick UI validation, you can seed sample data into your Supabase project.

- Ensure environment variables are set in `.env`:
  - REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL
  - REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY

Then run from the `nutrition_frontend` directory:

- node scripts/seedSupabase.js

Alternatively, in development mode, a "Seed Sample Data" button is available in Settings pages (Profile, Billing, Notifications) that performs a minimal seed using the browser client.

See SUPABASE_SETUP.md for detailed instructions and table expectations.
